I know their are better ways for some of these. And I appreciate any feedback on how I can do better however, this is old code and it's only homework that I had to do last year. With that being said I did get a 100% on nearly everything uploaded HOWEVER PLEASE DON'T just copy and paste. I am posting this to try to help guide someone to the right path of figuring their code out. This is also a disclaimer I don not know how your instructor will grade your HW and don't fully trust what I post. Thanks and have a great day :D
